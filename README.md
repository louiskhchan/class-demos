# Cognitive Psychology demos

I used plain JavaScript and the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) of HTML5 to program animations and interactive experiments to demonstrate principles of cognitive psychology in my classes. 

## Simon effect

The [Simon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_effect) is a kind of response compatibility effect. It says that when you respond to a property (e.g., the colour of an object) using your left and right hands, you are likely to do it quicker and better if the thing appears on the same side of the response. If it appears on the opposite side, your responses are slower and more erroneous.

This is a <ins>[demo](https://louiskhchan.github.io/class-demos/simon_effect/)</ins> of the effect that I made for my classes. Give it a try and see whether it works for you!

## Composite face effect

The [Composite face effect](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1131-5) is a face perception phenomenon that demonstrates that we tend to see a face as a whole. As a result, it is generally challenging to focus on one part of a face while ignoring the rest. The composite face effect says that when you are asked to focus only on the top part of a face, your recognition is disturbed by the bottom part of the face. For example, in the above faces (the left pair), the top halves of the faces are all identical, but they *might* look slightly different since we automatically take the bottom half of the face (which is changed) into account. However, if the face halves are misaligned (the right pair), this effect goes away because the misalignment stops our brains from treating the image as a whole 'face'.

This is a [demo experiment](https://louiskhchan.github.io/class-demos/composite_effect/index.htm?id=testuser) that I wrote for my class.
